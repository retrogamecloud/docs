Modern AI-powered development tools can significantly improve your documentation workflow. This guide covers the setup and best practices for the most popular AI coding assistants: Claude Code, Cursor, and Windsurf.

## Overview

| Tool | Best For | Pricing | Key Features |
|------|----------|---------|--------------|
| Claude Code | Documentation writing | Pro/API subscription | CLI interface, context-aware |
| Cursor | Code editing with AI | Free/Pro tiers | VS Code fork, inline suggestions |
| Windsurf | Full-stack development | Free/Pro tiers | Multi-file editing, project understanding |

## Claude Code Setup

Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI tool, excellent for documentation workflows.

### Prerequisites

- Active Claude subscription (Pro, Max, or API access)

- Node.js installed

### Installation

1. Install Claude Code globally:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

```

2. Navigate to your docs directory
3. Add the `CLAUDE.md` configuration file (see below)
4. Run `claude` to start

### Configuration

Create a `CLAUDE.md` file at the root of your documentation repository:

````markdown

# Mintlify Documentation Assistant

## Working Relationship

- Push back on ideas when needed - cite sources and explain reasoning

- ALWAYS ask for clarification rather than making assumptions

- NEVER lie, guess, or make up information

## Project Context

- Format: MDX files with YAML frontmatter

- Config: docs.json for navigation, theme, settings

- Components: Mintlify components available

## Content Strategy

- Document just enough for user success

- Prioritize accuracy and usability

- Make content evergreen when possible

- Check for existing content before adding new

- Maintain consistency with existing patterns

- Start with smallest reasonable changes

## Writing Standards

- Second-person voice ("you", "your")

- Active voice when possible

- Clear, concise sentences

- Consistent terminology

- Proper heading hierarchy

## File Naming Convention

- ALL .mdx files MUST use format X.Y. Title in frontmatter

- Example: `1.0. Getting Started` not `getting-started`

- Verify numbering consistency across all files

- Update frontmatter title to match filename format

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing any content:

1. Verify all .mdx files follow X.Y. Title format
2. Check frontmatter title consistency
3. Ensure proper heading hierarchy
4. Validate internal links
5. Test code examples
6. Review for accessibility
