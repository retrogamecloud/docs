Modern AI-powered development tools can significantly improve your documentation workflow. This guide covers the setup and best practices for the most popular AI coding assistants: Claude Code, Cursor, and Windsurf.

## Overview

| Tool | Best For | Pricing | Key Features |
|------|----------|---------|--------------|
| Claude Code | Documentation writing | Pro/API subscription | CLI interface, context-aware |
| Cursor | Code editing with AI | Free/Pro tiers | VS Code fork, inline suggestions |
| Windsurf | Full-stack development | Free/Pro tiers | Multi-file editing, project understanding |

## Claude Code Setup

Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI tool, excellent for documentation workflows.

### Prerequisites

- Active Claude subscription (Pro, Max, or API access)
- Node.js installed

### Installation

1. Install Claude Code globally:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

2. Navigate to your docs directory
3. Add the `CLAUDE.md` configuration file (see below)
4. Run `claude` to start

### Configuration

Create a `CLAUDE.md` file at the root of your documentation repository:

````markdown
# Mintlify Documentation Assistant

## Working Relationship
- Push back on ideas when needed - cite sources and explain reasoning
- ALWAYS ask for clarification rather than making assumptions  
- NEVER lie, guess, or make up information

## Project Context
- Format: MDX files with YAML frontmatter
- Config: docs.json for navigation, theme, settings
- Components: Mintlify components available

## Content Strategy
- Document just enough for user success
- Prioritize accuracy and usability
- Make content evergreen when possible
- Check for existing content before adding new
- Maintain consistency with existing patterns
- Start with smallest reasonable changes

## Writing Standards
- Second-person voice ("you")
- Prerequisites at start of procedures
- Test all code examples
- Include basic and advanced use cases
- Language tags on all code blocks
- Alt text on all images
- Clear, descriptive titles and descriptions
````

## Cursor Setup

Cursor is a VS Code fork with built-in AI assistance.

### Installation

1. Download from [cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh)
2. Install like any desktop application
3. Import your VS Code settings (optional)

### Key Features

- **Tab completion**: AI suggests code as you type
- **Cmd+K**: Generate code from natural language
- **Cmd+L**: Chat with AI about your code
- **@ symbols**: Reference specific files or documentation

### Best Practices

```javascript
// Use descriptive comments for better AI suggestions
// TODO: Add error handling for API calls
const fetchUserData = async (userId) => {
  // AI will suggest appropriate implementation
}
```

## Windsurf Setup

Windsurf excels at understanding entire project contexts and making multi-file changes.

### Installation

1. Download from [codeium.com/windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf)
2. Create account or sign in
3. Open your documentation project

### Key Features

- **Cascade**: Multi-file AI editing
- **Project understanding**: Analyzes entire codebase
- **Smart suggestions**: Context-aware recommendations
- **Collaborative editing**: Real-time AI assistance

### Workflow Integration

1. Open your docs project in Windsurf
2. Use Cascade for large refactoring tasks
3. Let AI analyze project structure for consistency
4. Use chat for planning documentation improvements

## Documentation-Specific Tips

### For All Tools

<Tip>
Always review AI-generated content for accuracy and consistency with your brand voice.
</Tip>

### Content Creation Workflow

1. **Planning**: Use AI chat to brainstorm topics and structure
2. **Writing**: Let AI help with first drafts and examples
3. **Review**: AI can check for consistency and completeness
4. **Testing**: Verify all code examples work as expected

### Common Prompts

```text
"Create a troubleshooting section for [feature]"
"Generate code examples for [API endpoint]"  
"Review this documentation for clarity and completeness"
"Suggest improvements for user onboarding flow"
```

### Integration with Mintlify

All three tools work well with Mintlify's MDX format:

```mdx

---

<Info>
AI tools can help generate structured content like this info block.
</Info>

## Code Examples

AI assistants excel at creating properly formatted code blocks:

```javascript
// AI can generate realistic, working examples
const config = {
  apiKey: process.env.API_KEY,
  baseURL: 'https://api.example.com'
};
```

## Best Practices

### Security Considerations

<Warning>
Never include sensitive information like API keys or passwords in AI prompts.
</Warning>

- Use placeholder values in examples
- Review generated code for security issues
- Keep proprietary information out of AI conversations

### Quality Control

1. **Fact-check**: Verify all technical information
2. **Test**: Run all code examples before publishing
3. **Review**: Ensure content matches your style guide
4. **Update**: Keep AI-generated content current

### Productivity Tips

- **Consistent prompts**: Develop standard prompts for common tasks
- **Context files**: Maintain updated context files for each tool
- **Iterative improvement**: Refine prompts based on results
- **Team alignment**: Share successful prompts with your team

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Claude Code not starting**: Check API key configuration and subscription status

**Cursor suggestions not appearing**: Verify internet connection and try restarting

**Windsurf project analysis slow**: Large projects may need time for initial analysis

### Getting Help

- Claude Code: Check Anthropic documentation
- Cursor: Visit cursor.sh/docs  
- Windsurf: See Codeium support resources

## Next Steps

1. Choose the tool that best fits your workflow
2. Set up configuration files for consistent results
3. Start with simple documentation tasks
4. Gradually integrate AI assistance into your full workflow
5. Share learnings with your team

<Tip>
Consider using multiple tools - each has unique strengths that can complement your documentation process.
